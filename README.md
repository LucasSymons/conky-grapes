# conky-grapes

The Github repository is only a manually, poorly maintained mirror, only for visibility purppose. I use GitLab CE for my own projects (which has no mirroring feature on Community Edition). Please reach out for me [there](https://gitlab.nomagic.fr/popi/conky-grapes) if you need to interact (you can sign in with your Github account).

 
## What is it
This repository aims at providing you everything you need to be able to very quickly build a beautiful grapefruit-shaped lua/ conky adapted to your machine. A set of pre-defined colours allow to easily adapt your settings to different backgrounds.


## Why use it
To tune up your desktop of course! And because you can, as it is under GPLv3 License.


## How to use it
* If you already know your way around, all you need is:
  - install conky-full
  - clone this repo to ~/conky/conky-grapes
  - install the fonts
  - use `create_config.py` to generate your configuration
  - enjoy color combinations and spending a fairly big amount of time looking at those magic rings
