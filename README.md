# conky-grapes
On-going Work on my own config files with recent conky and lua versions. 

This repository is an attempt to make a proper use of git in order to maintain my .conkyrc and lua file I use for a set of rings used to show various metrics on my several Linux desktops.

We use a python script to update configuration of both conky and lua rings in order to easily adapt settings to different linux machines.
